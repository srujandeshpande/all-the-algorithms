# Contributing Guidelines
Contributions are welcome from everyone! Please follow the guidelines so your contributions can smoothly be integrated into this repository :)

## Adding an algorithm in a new language
1. Go through the markdown file in the algorithm's folder to understand how the algorithm works.
2. The markdown file has the input and output format specified. Make sure you follow that.
3. Double-check to make sure the language does not already exist in that algorithm.
4. Fork this repository.
5. Create a new branch with a name relating to the algorithm and proposed langauge.
6. Add your code.
7. Add helpful comments to your code.
8. Thoroughly test your code. You can make use of the sample inputs if they are present.
9. Create a new Pull Request following the template. The Pull Request should be related to only 1 algorithm and 1 language.
10. Success!
