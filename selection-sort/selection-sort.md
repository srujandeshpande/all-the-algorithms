# Selection Sort

### Algorithm:
Traverse through the list. For every element, traverse through all the elements ahead of it and swap with any number smaller than it.

### Input format:
1. Number of elements - Integer
2. Elements - Integers seperated by a space

### Output format:
1. Sorted Elements - Integers seperated by a space

#### Notes:
It is not necessary to use the first input but it must be taken to maintain consistency.
